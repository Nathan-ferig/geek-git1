# Learning Repository

> This repository was created for educational and learning proporses.

This repository was created by me as part of an online course on Git & Github. This course was delivered by The Geek University and hosted at Udemy. It can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-de-git-e-github-essencial// "Git & Github essencial para o desenvolvedor").

In this course, I learned how to use Git and Github as a developer should know. 

Since I've already finish the course, this repository will be archieve and keeped as read-only.

Please, check out my other projects here in Github.
